# Banking Mini Project

## Description
This is the first project completed for a springboard Data Engineering Bootcamp. It's purpose was to utilize first few weeks learnings to create a very simplified banking system that would keep its data somewhere other than in memory. In my case this is a json file for each bank.

## Navigation

 - banking : contains all the module files for the project
 - data : contains the json data files generated by the operation of the module
 - docs : contains the UML diagram file for the project
 - logs : contains the log files for the project
 - test_banking.py : contains the test functions to be run by pytests

## Design

The modules were designed to contain an object for each Bank, Customer, Account, and CreditCard. For each of these objects, a list of objects was created as a class variable to hold each instance of the class. These were used to more easily use the classes together. Each object type has a list of dictionaries in the json file for its values, with each bank having its own json file. The modification of the attributes in each class object are reflected in the json file.


## Example Usage

```python console
#Create a Bank Object
bank = Bank('Sixth Bank and Trust')
bank_name = bank.name

#Create a Customer Object
Jeff = Customer(bank_name, 123456789, 'Jeff', 'Abe', '1234 Main st')

#Create a CheckingAccount Object
JeffsChecking = CheckingAccount(bank_name,Jeff.customer_id, 1000)

#Create a CreditCard Object
JeffsCard = CreditCard(bank_name, Jeff._customer_id)

#Spending on the Credit Card
JeffsCard.spend(100, JeffsCard.cvv,note='First Purchase')
JeffsCard.spend(100, JeffsCard.cvv+1)

#Paying off Credit Card
JeffsCard.pay(JeffsChecking.account_id,50)

print(JeffsCard.statement_balance)
print(JeffsCard.current_balance)

#Bank moves to the next month
bank.next_month()

print(JeffsCard.statement_balance)
print(JeffsCard.current_balance)

#More Spending
JeffsCard.spend(150, JeffsCard.cvv)

#Bank moves to the next month
bank.next_month()

print(JeffsCard.statement_balance)
print(JeffsCard.current_balance)

JeffsCard.pay(JeffsChecking.account_id,500)

bank.next_month()

print(JeffsCard.statement_balance)
print(JeffsCard.current_balance)

```
